## Notes

This comes with a default EMA50/200 crossover strategy.  I'd suggest replacing it with a strategy of your choice instead.  This scanner is useful for doing visual market research to identify correlations or as an informal backtest for a strategy you are developing.  For more mature strategies, a Tradingview alert can send a list of signalled entries for your review.
