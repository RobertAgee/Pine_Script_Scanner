## Notes

This scanner is useful for doing visual market research to identify correlations or as an informal backtest for a strategy you are developing.  For more mature strategies, a Tradingview alert can send a list of signalled entries and exits for your review.  Scanner comes with a few preset strategies, but I encourage adding a strategy(ies) of your own.
