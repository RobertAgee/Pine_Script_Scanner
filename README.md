## Notes

This scanner is useful for doing visual market research to identify correlations or as an informal backtest for a strategy you are developing.  For more mature strategies, a Tradingview alert can send a list of signalled entries and exits for your review.  Scanner comes with a few preset strategies, but I encourage adding a strategy(ies) of your own.

Each preset list is limited to 32 symbols.  By setting an alert on each preset list, it is possible to watch an unlimited number of symbols for any strategy.
